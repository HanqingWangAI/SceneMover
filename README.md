This repository is the implementation of our SIGGRAPH Asia 2020 paper:

[Scene Mover: Automatic Move Planning for Scene Arrangement by Deep Reinforcement Learning](#)

## Introduction
  We propose a novel approach for automatically generating a move plan for scene arrangement. Given a scene like an apartment with many furniture objects, to transform its layout into another layout, one would need to determine a collision-free move plan.

Please refer to our paper for the detailed formulations.

## Quick Start
#### Inference:
To be updated.
<!-- 1. Download the checkpoint of the agent to directory `snap/agent/state_dict/best_val_unseen`, the checkpoint of the speaker to directory `snap/speaker/state_dict/best_val_unseen_bleu`.
2. Start a Jupyter service and run the jupyter notebook [evaluation.ipynb](evaluation.ipynb). -->
